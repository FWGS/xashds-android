# XashDS Android - fork of FWGS's *xashds-android*
Android dedicated server with x86 dynamic translator and dll support [**custom modification**].
## Current version - v1.2-forked
### Current changes since mittorn's version:

* **New interface theme** (Material for Lollipop, Holo for elder Android versions)
* **Server master** for more comfortable server setup
* File and folder **selection activities** - pick them without editing path string directly
* **"Connect" button:** supporting two connection types:
  1. Connect directly
  2. Connect using "xashds_hacks"
* New **console output view** - supporting colorized text and **copying lines to clipboard**
* **Shortcut creator** for server
* **Command line support**: send command to server directly from app - control server without connecting to it
* Server running **in service** - you don't need to keep application opened while server is running. Also, last log message will be shown in **notification area**

*Also, i've added new-built-by-me xashds (0.19) binary. But it still can't load some ddl's. :( Working on fixing it*

*Contact me (yagreg7@gmail.com) if some fatures are not working or on bugs detected. Enjoy.*
